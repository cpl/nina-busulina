Having found my grandmother's cooking notebooks, with hundreds of handwritten pages, newspaper and cookbook clips of recipes that bring back the sweet memories of childhood.

The notes are in a rather ... poor shape after years of wear and tear, but restoration is possible but it will take time (as this also includes restoration, decoding of the handwriting and translation from Romanian).

Like any 90s easter european grandmother (commonly known as Babushka) she would cook the best deserts, she wouldn't stop nagging you until you eat another portion of borscht and of course she would make jam, kompot and other such things.

My grandmother, Nina Copil, died December 2011. She is why I have a passion for cooking and other household activities. She never got to see me grow and become the cook that I am today, following heir recipes, baking bread and more.

This website is dedicated to showcasing and preserving her recipes and honoring her memory.
